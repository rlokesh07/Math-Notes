\section{Parametric Equations and Polar Coordinates}

\subsection{Parametric Equations}

If x and y are continuous functions, then 
\[ x = x(t) \text{ and } y = y(t) \]
are parametric equations, and t is the parameter. The points that are obtained 
when t is varied over an interval is the graph, or is called the parametric curve.
\smallskip
\par To understand parametric functions further, you can eliminate the parameter by 
relating t to x and y. For the function $x(t) = 4\cos t$ and $y(t) = 3\sin t$, 
divide both sides by 4 and 3 respectivly and plug the cosine and sin functions into 
the Pythagoreus identity to create the equation of a circle.
